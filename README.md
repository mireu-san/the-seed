# Welcome, visitor.
This is what I am thinking to do.

# Blueprint:
1. Welcome screen (client side)
2. Admin's page (client side)
3. About page
4. Portfolio link page
5. contact page

# Agile methodology
1. Welcome screen (act as welcome page)
- As a visitor, I want to move on to the main screen.
- As a developer, I need to set up main screen.
- Separated page, background image, transition effect.
- this may belongs to index.html.

2. Admin's page (act as main screen)
- As a visitor, I want to explore and click 'about, portfolio, contact' link.
- As a developer, I need to set up link/menu bar for visitor.
- Mainly composed as :
1. Right side : menu(link) 
2. Left side : Main page of each link to display it (once clicked).

### Literally. Each page design will follow the admin's page:
3. About page
4. Portfolio link page
5. contact page
